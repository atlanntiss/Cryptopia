# Cryptopia.

Cryptopia is a cryptologic utility, which is going to help you to work with some encryption methods, explore ciphers and hash functions, do cryptanalysis using common techniques of breaking cryptosystems, and have fun. Cryptopia is a beautiful and user-friendly tool made with love.

## The list of functions.

### Ciphers:
- Caesar cipher (bruteforce cryptanalysis is available).
- Vigenere cipher (Kasiski examination attack is available).
- Transposition cipher (bruteforce cryptanalysis is available).

### Hash functions:
- MD4.
- MD5.
- SHA1.
- SHA224.
- SHA256.
- SHA384.
